    <h1>Bismuth - Run Online</h1>
    <p>
        Bismuth is a familiar, expressive, easy-to-learn language that tries to keep code predictable and easy to refactor.
        At the moment, it's implemented as a transpiler to JavaScript and C.
        In the future, it should be able to target LLVM and/or x86 directly.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    The Bismuth compiler is implemented in TypeScript, which allows it to run on this page.
